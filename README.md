<h2 align="center">🌟 Introduction</h2>

<p align="center">
  Dive into the world of numerical methods and differentiation techniques with our curated Jupyter Notebooks. 📚
</p>

<h2 align="center">📚 Notebooks</h2>

1. [**Numerical Methods Overview**](Numerical_Methods_Overview.ipynb): 🧮 Explore essential numerical methods, including root finding (Bisection, Newton-Raphson), numerical integration (Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule), and linear equation solving (Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition).

2. [**Lagrange Interpolation**](Lagrange_Interpolation.ipynb): 📊 Master Lagrange interpolation, a powerful technique for approximating functions using polynomials that pass through given data points.

3. [**Hermite Interpolation**](Hermite_Interpolation.ipynb): 📈 Delve into Hermite interpolation, an extension of Lagrange interpolation that incorporates derivative information at data points for enhanced accuracy.

4. [**Newton's Divided Differences**](Newtons_Divided_Differences.ipynb): ➗ Uncover the magic of Newton's Divided Differences method for polynomial interpolation, employing a recursive approach to construct interpolating polynomials.

5. [**Differentiation and Richardson Extrapolation**](Differentiation_and_Richardson_Extrapolation.ipynb): 📐 Embark on a journey of differentiation methods (forward, backward, central) and Richardson extrapolation. Witness the world of numerical differentiation and error calculation in action.
