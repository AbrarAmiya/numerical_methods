<h2 align="center">🌟 Introduction</h2>

<p align="center">
  Dive into the captivating realm of numerical methods and differentiation techniques through our interactive Jupyter Notebooks. 📚
</p>

<h2 align="center">📚 Notebooks</h2>

1. [**Numerical Methods Overview**](Numerical_Methods_Overview.ipynb): 🧮 Discover vital numerical methods, from unleashing the power of root finding (Bisection, Newton-Raphson) to taming complex integrals (Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule) and mastering linear equation solutions (Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition).

2. [**Lagrange Interpolation**](Lagrange_Interpolation.ipynb): 📊 Master the art of Lagrange interpolation, a spellbinding technique to approximate functions using magical polynomials that traverse through given data points.

3. [**Hermite Interpolation**](Hermite_Interpolation.ipynb): 📈 Venture into the enigmatic world of Hermite interpolation, a mystical extension of Lagrange interpolation that imbues derivative knowledge at data points for enhanced precision.

4. [**Newton's Divided Differences**](Newtons_Divided_Differences.ipynb): ➗ Unearth the hidden treasures of Newton's Divided Differences method for polynomial interpolation, employing a recursive wizardry to conjure interpolating polynomials.

5. [**Differentiation and Richardson Extrapolation**](Differentiation_and_Richardson_Extrapolation.ipynb): 📐 Embark on an odyssey of differentiation methods (forward, backward, central) and unveil the secrets of Richardson extrapolation. Behold the spectacle of numerical differentiation and error revelation.

<h2 align="center">✨ Features</h2>

- 💡 Illuminate your understanding with lucid explanations and meticulously crafted code incantations.
- 🎨 Behold wondrous visualizations orchestrated by Matplotlib, unraveling the mysteries of intricate concepts.
- 🔍 Immerse in the fusion of common mathematical incantations, enabling you to explore diverse function realms.
- 👣 Embark on a guided journey through each method, from the inception of equations to the intricate tapestry of calculations.

<h2 align="center">🚀 Usage</h2>

1. 🧙‍♂️ Cast the spell to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbrarAmiya/numerical-methods.git
   ```

2. 📜 Unveil the sacred scrolls of knowledge by opening your chosen Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `Lagrange_Interpolation.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

3. 🚀 Traverse through the incantations within the code cells to witness the unfolding of implementations, mystical visualizations, and enlightening elucidations for each method.

<h2 align="center">🛠 Installation</h2>

The incantations are scribed in Python and are powered by mystical libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. These arcane artifacts are often pre-imbued within Python realms and seldom require separate summoning.
